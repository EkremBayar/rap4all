# Testing your code

Testing code is crucial, and we all do it in some form or another. The problem
is that it is not something that we do consistently. Usually code gets tested in
the beginning of a project, but then, as we start focusing on the analysis more
and more and need to respect deadlines, testing gets forgotten.

In this chapter, you are going to learn how to make testing your code consistent
and, very importantly, fully automatic. Just like in the previous chapter, the
key is to *write everything down*. Don’t just do a little test in the console to
see if the function you’ve just written works as expected. Write it down! And
don’t rely on future you to run tests, because future you is just as unreliable
as you are. Tests need to be run each time *any* of the code from a project gets
changed. This might seem overkill (why test a function that you didn’t even
touch for weeks?), but because there are dependencies between your functions, a
change in one function can affect another. Especially if the output of function
A is the input of function B, and now, because of your changes, the output of
function A changed in a way that it breaks function B, or also modifies its
output in an unexpected way.

There are several types of tests that we can use:

- unit testing: these are written while developing, and executed while developing;
- assertive testing: these are executed at runtime. These make sure, for example, that the inputs a function receives are sane.

Let’s start with unit testing.

## Unit testing

Unit testing is the testing of units. What’s a unit? Functions are units! We actually
already encountered one unit test before, in the `save_data.Rmd` script:

````{verbatim}

```{r tests-clean_flat_data}
# We now need to check if we have them all in the data.
# The test needs to be self-contained, hence
# why we need to redefine the required variables:

former_communes <- get_former_communes()

current_communes <- get_current_communes()

communes <- get_test_communes(
  former_communes,
  current_communes
)

raw_data <- get_raw_data(
  url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/raw/master/datasets/vente-maison-2010-2021.xlsx"
)

flat_data <- clean_raw_data(raw_data)

testthat::expect_true(
            all(communes %in% unique(flat_data$locality))
                      )
```

````

When using `{fusen}`, a unit test should be a self-contained chunk that can be
executed completely independently. This is why in this chunk we re-created the
different variables that we needed, `communes` and `flat_data`. If you were
developing the package without `{fusen}`, you would do the same, so don’t think
that this is somehow a limitation of `{fusen}`.

The test above ensures that we find all the former and current communes of
Luxembourg in our dataset. Let me explain again why we want to write such a test
down in a script and not simply try it out in our console.

For this test to pass, a lot of moving pieces have to fall together. If anything
changes, be it because you changed something in either `get_raw_data()` or
`clean_raw_data()` or because something changed with the Wikipedia tables you
scraped, this test will not pass. And you should be made aware of failures as
soon as possible! Also, this test ensures that when the data gets updated, you
are certain that if you use the code in `save_data.Rmd` you will get a new
dataset that is likely correct, even if new communes merge. And mergers will
happen around 2024 by the way, the communes of Groussbous and Wal will merge,
and the communes of Bous and Waldbredimus as well. So you need to make sure that
when this happens, your code knows how to handle this, or at least gives out an
error as early as possible.

Ideally, we would test every function that we wrote, but sometimes that’s not
really possible, either due to lack of time, or because the function is quite
trivial, so maybe no test is warranted. But be careful what you consider trivial
though, I have personally been bitten in the past by trivially simple functions!
For example, a function like this one:

````{verbatim}
```{r function-make_commune_level_data}
#' make_commune_level_data Makes the final data at commune level
#'
#' @param flat_data Flat data df as returned by clean_flat_data()
#' @importFrom dplyr filter
#' @return A data frame
#' @export
make_commune_level_data <- function(flat_data){
  flat_data |>
    filter(!grepl("nationale|offres", locality),
           !is.na(locality))
}

```
````

might not need to be unit-tested. An assertion, which we will learn about in the
next section, is likely better suited. However, as functions become more
complex, unit tests are highly recommended. This is because it can become very
difficult to make sure that changing some part of the function somewhere does
not affect some other part. This is where writing several unit tests can be
useful. As long as all unit tests keep succeeding (or passing) you are somewhat
sure that what you’re doing is not breaking stuff. And unit tests are especially
useful when collaborating using trunk-based development! As the project leader,
you could for example refuse to merge changes that break unit tests (the first
project I worked on that used unit tests was organized like this, so we all
better made sure that we wrote sensible code).

Before continuing, let’s rewrite the test we have already. While it is fully
working, I didn’t really write it in the canonical form. Inside
`dev/save_data.Rmd`, change the code of the test to the following:

````{verbatim}
```{r tests-clean_flat_data}
# We now need to check if we have them all in the data.
# The test needs to be self-contained, hence
# why we need to redefine the required variables:

former_communes <- get_former_communes()

current_communes <- get_current_communes()

communes <- get_test_communes(
  former_communes,
  current_communes
)

raw_data <- get_raw_data(
  url = "https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/raw/master/datasets/vente-maison-2010-2021.xlsx"
)

flat_data <- clean_raw_data(raw_data)

test_that("Check if all communes are accounted for", {

  expect_true(
    all(communes %in% unique(flat_data$locality))
  )

})
```
````

The only difference is that instead of calling `testthat::expect_true()`
directly, we have wrapped this call inside `testthat::test_that()`. This way, we
can add a description to the test. This is useful if the test fails.

Save `dev/save_data.Rmd` and go back to `0-dev_history.Rmd` to inflate
`save_data.Rmd` again. Everything should work without problems.

If the test fails, you get an informative message. To illustrate, I’ve added a
typo in the test and inflated `save_data.Rmd`. Because tests always run when
files get inflated, this test failed and here is what happened:

```
══ Failed tests ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
── Error ('test-get_raw_data.R:18'): Check if all communes are accounted for ───
Error in `communs %in% unique(flat_data$locality)`: object 'communs' not found

Error: Test failures

```

The file `test-get_raw_data.R` contains our test, generated by inflating
`save_data.Rmd`. You can find it under the `tests/testthat/` folder of your
inflated package. You can also see the description that we’ve added, which helps
us find the test that failed. In cases like this, you should go back to the
function that makes the test fail and correct it, until the test passes. You
should also make sure that everything is alright with the test itself. If there
really is a typo in the test, you should of course correct the test (in
`dev/save_data.Rmd`, not in `tests/testthat/`)!

Now, let’s add a unit test to another function, `get_laspeyeres()`. This
function seems to me like a good candidate for testing, as it is not that
trivial.

Let’s try with something simple. `get_laspeyeres()` expects either
`commune_level_data` or `country_level_data`. What happens if we provide another
dataset? Very likely an error. So let’s test for this. Go back to the
`save_data.Rmd` file and add the following, under the function definition of
`get_laspeyeres()`:


````{verbatim}
```{r tests-get_laspeyeres}
test_that("Wrong data", {

  expect_error(
    get_laspeyeres(mtcars)
  )

})
```
````

Since we expect an error, we used `expect_error()`, which succeeds if the code
fails! If you’re confused, no worries, we’ve all been there. But let’s think
about it: what would you want to happen if you provided a wrong data set?
Surely, you’d like for the function to scream an error at you, and not somehow
do something and return *something*. So testing that functions fail when they
should is actually quite important as well. Let’s add another, similar, test:

````{verbatim}
```{r tests-get_laspeyeres}

test_that("Wrong data", {

  expect_error(
    get_laspeyeres(mtcars)
  )

})

test_that("Empty data", {

  expect_error(
    get_laspeyeres(subset(mtcars, am == 2))
  )

})

```
````

This second test checks what happens if we provide an empty dataset. This should
not happen, but hey, it’s always a good idea to see what could happen. Here we
also expect an error, so we use `expect_error()` as well. Inflating
`save_data.Rmd` runs the tests again, all of them successfully.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. Probably something along the lines of *"Bruno,
you told me that making my projects reproducible and reliable and robust would
not take much more time than what I was already doing before. This certainly
doesn’t feel like it!"*, to which I answer that your feelings on the issue are
wrong. It may not feel like it, but doing this does two things:

- It ultimately saves you time. You typed the test once, and can now rerun it automatically every time you inflate the `.Rmd` files. You don’t need to remember to test the code, and don’t need to remember how to test the code.
- This saves you a lot of headaches. You don’t have to live in fear that you might forget to test the code, or forget how to test the code. You wrote the tests down, and now you’re free to concentrate on adding features or using the existing code knowing that you can trust its outputs.

Trust the process.

Let’s go back to the two tests from before: `get_laspeyeres()` fails, as
expected, when we provide a random dataset to it. But it would be interesting to
know why it fails. Simply run `get_laspeyeres(mtcars)` in the console. This is
what we get back:

```{r, eval = F}
Error in `mutate()`:
! Problem while computing `p0 = ifelse(year == "2010",
  average_price_nominal_euros, NA)`.
Caused by error in `ifelse()`:
! object 'year' not found
Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.
```

So the functions fails but for the wrong reason. It fails because the column
`year` cannot be found in the data. But what if there was a column `year`? The
code would continue, but then likely fail for something else. It would be much
safer to make it fail as soon as it detects that the provided data sets are not
one of `commune_level_data` and `country_level_data`. But for this, we need
assertive programming, which we will discuss in the next section. Remember, unit
testing tests should run during development time, and assertive testing is for
run-time. In the next section we will be changing the function to fail when the
right datasets are not provided, but our unit test will not need to change; the
function still fails, but this time it’ll be for the right reasons.

This is another advantage of writing unit tests: it forces you to think about
what you’re doing. It very often improves your code quite a lot, and not just
from a pure algorithmic perspective, but also from a user experience
perspective. Writing these tests made us think about the failure of our
function when we provide a random dataset, and made us realise that it would be
much better for users if the returned error message is something such as "Wrong
dataset, please provide either `commune_level_data` or `country_level_data`".

Let’s continue with testing `get_laspeyeres()`. It would be nice to see if the
function actually does what it’s supposed to do correctly. For this, we need to
start from an input, and then create the expected output. It doesn’t matter how
you create this output, what matters is that you make absolutely sure that it is
correct, and then, never touch it ever again. Let’s call this output the
"truth". Then, you provide `get_laspeyeres()` with this input and save the
output that `get_laspeyeres()` generates. You then compare the "truth" to this
output. If everything matches, congratulations, your function produces the right
output.

So let’s start. Remember that unit tests should be self-contained, so I’m going
to create the input dataset and the expected data set (what I called the "truth")
in the test itself. This is the code I’m going to use to create the mock, input
dataset:

```{r, eval = F}
input_df <- expand.grid(
  list("year" = c(2010, 2011),
       "locality" = c("Bascharage", "Luxembourg"))
)

input_df$n_offers <- c(123, 101, 1230, 1010)
input_df$average_price_nominal_euros <- c(234, 345, 560, 670)
input_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros <- c(23, 34, 56, 67)
```

This creates a data frame with two years, two communes and some mock prices. 
Now, I need to create the output. I start from the input, and add the columns
that `get_laspeyeres()` computes "by hand". Remember, you need to make sure
that these results are correct!

```{r, eval = F}
expected_df <- input_df

# p0 should be always equal to the value in the first year
expected_df$p0 <- c(234, 234, 560, 560)
expected_df$p0_m2 <- c(23, 23, 56, 56)

# pl should be equal to the price divided by p0
expected_df$pl <- expected_df$average_price_nominal_euros/expected_df$p0 * 100
expected_df$pl_m2 <- expected_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros/expected_df$p0_m2 * 100
```

If you look at each line, you see that this is basically what `get_laspeyeres()`
does. We can inspect the results, maybe even calculate each cell using a pocket
calculator. It doesn’t matter, what’s important is that the `expected_df` is
correct and saved. This is what the full test looks like:

````{verbatim}
```{r, eval = F}
test_that("get_laspeyeres() produces correct results", {

  input_df <- expand.grid(
    list("year" = c(2010, 2011),
         "locality" = c("Bascharage", "Luxembourg"))
  )

  input_df$n_offers <- c(123, 101, 1230, 1010)
  input_df$average_price_nominal_euros <- c(234, 345, 560, 670)
  input_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros <- c(23, 34, 56, 67)

  expected_df <- input_df

  # p0 should be always equal to the value in the first year
  expected_df$p0 <- c(234, 234, 560, 560)
  expected_df$p0_m2 <- c(23, 23, 56, 56)

  # pl should be equal to the price divided by p0
  expected_df$pl <- expected_df$average_price_nominal_euros/expected_df$p0 * 100
  expected_df$pl_m2 <- expected_df$average_price_m2_nominal_euros/expected_df$p0_m2 * 100

  expect_equivalent(
    expected_df, get_laspeyeres(input_df)
  )

})
```
````

Notice that I’ve used `expect_equivalent()` and not `expect_equal()`. This is because
`expected_df` is of class `data.frame`, while `get_laspeyeres()` outputs a `tibble`.
So if you use `expect_equal()` the test would not pass. Sometimes, this level of 
strictness is required, but not always, as is the case here.

Once again, inflate `save_data.Rmd`. This will run the tests, and if everything
went well, you should end up, again, with a functioning package. I highly
advise that you consult `{testthat}`’s documentation to learn about all the other
functions that you can use for writing unit tests.

Let’s now go to assertive programming.

## Assertive programming

Remember in chapter 6, where I discussed safe functions? As a refresher, here’s the `nchar()`
function, providing a correct output when the input is a character:

```{r}
nchar("100000000")
```

and here is `nchar()` providing a *surprising* result when the input is a number:

```{r}
nchar(100000000)
```

This is because `100000000` gets converted to `1e+08` and then this gets converted into the 
string `"1e+08"` which is 5 characters long. So in that section, I suggested to define your
own `nchar2()` that makes sure that the provided input is a character:

```{r}
nchar2 <- function(x, result = 0){

  if(!isTRUE(is.character(x))){
    stop(paste0("x should be of type 'character', but is of type '",
                typeof(x), "' instead."))
  } else if(x == ""){
    result
  } else {
    result <- result + 1
    split_x <- strsplit(x, split = "")[[1]]
    nchar2(paste0(split_x[-1],
                  collapse = ""), result)
  }
}
```

This now returns an error if the input is a number, instead of doing all these
silent conversions. The technique we have used here is what we call assertive
programming. `stop()` and `stopifnot()` are functions included with R that can
be used for assertive programming. Here is an example using `stopifnot()`:

```{r}
nchar3 <- function(x, result = 0){

  stopifnot("Input x must be a character" =
              isTRUE(is.character(x)))

  if(x == ""){
    result
  } else {
    result <- result + 1
    split_x <- strsplit(x, split = "")[[1]]
    nchar3(paste0(split_x[-1],
                  collapse = ""), result)
  }
}

```

If we go back to `get_laspeyeres()`, we should be using assertive programming to make
sure that the provided datasets are one of `commune_level_data` and `country_level_data`. 
This is how we could rewrite the function:

```{r, eval = F}
get_laspeyeres <- function(dataset){

  which_dataset <- deparse(substitute(dataset))

  stopifnot("dataset must be one of `commune_level_data` or `country_level_data`" =
              (which_dataset %in% c("commune_level_data", "country_level_data")))

  group_var <- if(grepl("commune", which_dataset)){
                 quo(locality)
               } else {
                 NULL
               }
  dataset |>
    group_by(!!group_var) |>
    mutate(p0 = ifelse(year == "2010", average_price_nominal_euros, NA)) |>
    fill(p0, .direction = "down") |>
    mutate(p0_m2 = ifelse(year == "2010", average_price_m2_nominal_euros, NA)) |>
    fill(p0_m2, .direction = "down") |>
    ungroup() |>
    mutate(pl = average_price_nominal_euros/p0*100,
           pl_m2 = average_price_m2_nominal_euros/p0_m2*100)

}
```

We can now also edit the unit test from before, the one where we provide the
wrong data. This unit test would fail, as expected, but for the wrong reason. We
now want to make sure that it fails for the right reason, so for this we change
the unit tests like this:

```{r, eval = F}
test_that("Wrong data", {

  expect_error(
    get_laspeyeres(mtcars),
    regexp = "dataset must be one of"
  )

})
```

I use the `regexp` argument of `expect_error` to enter a regular expression that
matches the error message. So the string "dataset must be one of" will match the
message returned by the error, and if they match (remember, the provided string
is a regular expression), then I know I get the *correct* error. Here is what
happens if I use the wrong message as the `regex` argument:

```
══ Failed tests ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
── Failure ('test-get_laspeyeres.R:6'): Wrong data ─────────────────────────────
`get_laspeyeres(mtcars)` threw an error with unexpected message.
Expected match: "message is wrong"
Actual message: "dataset must be one of `commune_level_data` or `country_level_data`"
```

So now, not only does our function fail for the right reasons, our test is able
to tell us that as well!

Before inflating to run these tests, you should also change the test titled
"get_laspeyeres() provides correct answers". This is because the name of the
input dataset used for the test is `input_df`. So if you leave it like this, the
assertion that we’ve included in the function will make this test fail. So change this
test by simply saving `input_df` `commune_level_data`:

```{r, eval = F}
commune_level_data <- input_df

expect_equivalent(
  expected_df, get_laspeyeres(commune_level_data)
)
```

if you forget to do this, don’t worry, the unit test would fail to remind you!

Go back to `0-dev_history.Rmd` and inflate the file again to update it. The unit
test we wrote before should keep passing, but now, it passes for the right
reason: we provided a dataset that is neither `commune_level_data` nor
`country_level_data` and not because there is no column `year` in the dataset!

You can also make sure that the provided input is of the right class:

```{r}
any_function <- function(dataset){

  stopifnot("`dataset` must be a data frame" =
              inherits(dataset, "data.frame"))

  print("No problem")
}
```

This will succeed:

```{r}
any_function(mtcars)
```

But this will fail:

```{r, eval = F}
any_function("this is not a data frame")
```

```
Error in any_function("this is not a data frame") : 
  `dataset` must be a data frame
```

`inherits()` checks if an option inherits from a certain class. So for example,
a `tibble` or a `data.table` that are classes that are defined by inheriting
attributes from the `data.frame` class, will also successfully pass the test
above. You can be as strict as you need: for example, do you need any type of
number? You could do the following:

```{r}
inherits(2, "numeric")
```

But do you actually need integers, and want to force this? Then you could be
stricter in your assertion:

```{r}
inherits(2, "integer")
```

If you want the above to evaluate to `TRUE`, an integer must be provided:

```{r}
inherits(2L, "integer")
```

Do you want, for some reason, that your functions only accept `tibble`s and not
`data.frame`s? Be as strict as you need:

```{r}
inherits(tibble::as_tibble(mtcars), "tbl_df")
```

```{r}
inherits(mtcars, "tbl_df")
```

You could also use more complex assertions. For example, suppose that you need to clean
data using many functions, with several filters. Something could go wrong in any of these
functions for a variety of reasons. So each of these functions could test if all the 
individuals are still in the data, and that you didn’t remove any of them by mistake.
A test like:

```{r, eval = F}

summary_stats <- function(dataframe, var){
  stopifnot("Some individuals are missing!" =
              all((unique(dataframe[[var]])) %in% c(0,1)))

  # and then some comptutations here
}

```

Now, when running `summary_stats(mtcars, "am")`, if somehow the level "1" or "0"
is missing from `mtcars`, the function would throw an error. 

There are several packages for assertive programming that you might want to
check out:

- [{assertthat}](https://github.com/hadley/assertthat)
- [{chk}](https://poissonconsulting.github.io/chk/)
- [{checkmate}](https://mllg.github.io/checkmate/)

I won’t discuss any of them; what’s important is for you to know that assertive
programming is something that is useful, and that you should add to your
toolbox.

## Test-driven development

Test-driven development, or TDD, is the programming paradigm in which instead of
writing a function and then several tests to ensure that it’s working as
expected, you start with several tests. Of course, since there is no function to
test, these tests will all fail at first. But the goal is to then write a
function such that the tests pass.

TDD is interesting in at least two scenarios:

- You want to write a function, but don’t know exactly where to start. Maybe it’s a very complex function. So writing tests can help you think about it, and already fix certain properties that this function should have.
- You use the tests as a way to write requirements for a codebase. This can be useful when working in a team, and you don’t want to "waste" time writing requirements, so instead you already write the tests. Careful though, because a "smart" programmer could write code that passes the tests but doesn’t actually do anything otherwise useful.

I tend to use TDD when I need to write a function but don’t quite know where to
start. I start by writing the most basic tests and make them ever more
complicated. At some point, I start having an idea for the function’s
implementation and have a go at it. Sometimes this makes me even realise that I 
was testing for something irrelevant!

Some programmers only do TDD; so they start by writing many, many tests, and
then only start writing their functions. Personally, I think that this is also
not ideal, because you could waste a lot of time writing meaningless tests.

## Code coverage

It is useful to have an idea of which functions are tested and which are not, but
also *how much* of a function is being tested. For example, suppose that you have
an `if...else...` clause somewhere in a function. Did you write a test for each of 
the outcomes of this clause? Maybe you only wrote a test when this clause evaluates
to `TRUE`, but forgot to write a test for the case it is `FALSE`.

The packages `{covr}` allows you to track the test coverage of your package. 
Install `{covr}` and run `report()` in the console to get the results:

```{r, eval = F}
covr::report()
```

This should open a tab in your web browser with some statistics. You can click
on the individual scripts to see the source code of your functions: each line
that is highlighted in green represents a line that is being tested, and lines in red
are lines that are not being tested:

::: {.content-hidden when-format="pdf"}
<figure>
    <img src="images/covr.PNG"
         alt="The output of report() inside a web browser."></img>

You could strive to get 100% coverage by painting all the lines green (by writing
unit tests that test these lines). But in practice, it is not always so easy to 
get 100% coverage, so don’t fret if you don’t achieve perfection.

If you’re working on a server (and thus do not have access to a graphical user interface)
you can instead opt for the `covr::package_coverage()` function which provides you
with the following results (inside your console):

```
housing Coverage: 73.33%
R/get_laspeyeres.R: 57.14%
R/get_raw_data.R: 80.65%
```

The percentage represents the share of lines of code that are tested by our unit
tests. We see that the share of lines being tested in `get_laspeyeres().R` is
57%: this is because the script `get_laspeyeres()` contains two functions,
`get_laspeyeres()` and `make_plot()`. We do not test `make_plot()` at all, hence
why the percentage is so low. We could move `make_plot()` to another script by
simply putting the function under a level two header in the original `.Rmd`
file and then inflating again. But in any case, this would not improve the overall
coverage of the package; we would ideally need to write a test for `make_plot()`.
This is left as an exercise to the reader.

## Conclusion

Testing is crucial and useful. Not just because it gives you peace of mind but
also because writing tests forces you to think about your code, by putting
yourself in the shoes of your users (which include future you as well).
In most cases, it is even something that you’ve been doing but perhaps not as
systematically as you should. 

There really is no other way to say this: you need to consider writing tests as
an integral part of the project, and need to take the required time it takes to
write them into account when planning projects. But keep in mind that writing
them makes you gain a lot of time in the long run, so actually, you might
even be faster by writing tests! Tests also allow you to immediately see where
something went wrong, when something goes wrong. So tests save you time here as
well. Without tests, when something goes wrong, you have a hard time finding
where the bug comes from, and end up wasting precious time. And worse, sometimes
things go wrong and break, but silently. You still get an output that may look
ok at first glance, and only realise something is wrong way too late. Testing
helps avoiding such situations.

So remember: it might *feel* like packaging your code and writing tests for it 
takes time, but:

- you’re actually already doing it, albeit casually;
- it saves you time in the long run.

The tools I’ve showed you in this chapter and in the previous chapter are probably the
fastest, easiest way to go from your analysis to a documented and tested package
in a matter of hours. The benefits these provide however are measured in days of
work.
