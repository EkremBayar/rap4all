# Conclusion of part 2

Congratulations, you're done with the book (well, there's still the book's
overall conclusion) and I hope you learned a thing or two. 

Part 1 focused on teaching you best practices, tools and techniques to make your
code as clean as possible. In part 2, I taught how to turn your project into a
pipeline, and then how to make this pipeline reproducible using `{renv}` and
Docker. To summarise, here are all the things that we need to think about
to write a RAP:

- Write code that is as clean as possible: keep it DRY, document and test it well;
- Record package dependencies of the project;
- Record the R version that you use;
- Use a tool that builds the project for you;
- Record the computational environment.

If you tick all these boxes, you, or anyone else, should not have any 
problems reproducing the results of your project.
