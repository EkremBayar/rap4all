# Packaging your code

In this chapter you're going to learn how to create your own package.

*We should make clear that this does not mean publishing the package on CRAN.*

## Benefits of packages

## Intro to packge dev

*This is where fusen comes into play I guess; so we start from the Qmd file that was written
before, containing the functions an the analysis, and see how we can now create a package from it,
and use that file as a vignette? Copying here what SÃ©bastien said on the matter*

## Document your package (?)

*I guess fusen makes this process easy and leverages roxygen?*

## Managing package dependencies (?)

*Discuss NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION and all that. I think it's important to also discuss here
how to define dependencies from remotes, not just CRAN.*

## Unit testing

*This is where I think we should discuss unit testing*

## pkgdown
