# Conclusion of part 1

Before continuing, let’s quickly summarise what we’ve learned so far.

We started our journey with two scripts that download and analyse date about housing
in Luxembourg. We then learned about tools and programming paradigms that we will now
use in part 2 to make our scripts more robust:

- Version control;
- Functional programming;
- Testing;
- Literate programming.

We will start part 2 by rewriting our scripts using what we’ve learned, and then,
we will think about approaching the core problem differently, and structuring our 
project not as a series of scripts (or R Markdown files in the case of literate programming)
but instead as a pipeline. We will learn about tools that will capture the computational
environment that was used to set up this pipeline and how to use them effectively to make
sure that our project is reproducible.
