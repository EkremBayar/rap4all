# Getting started with your project

We suggest to not start with an R script, but start from a Qmd file.

*What SÃ©bastien said on the matter:* 

*There seems to be two way of presenting such a workflow:

What does the complete project looks like at the end and what tools do I need?
How do I start working on it?*

*This questions should get answered in the intro?*

*Refer to [https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/issues/1#issuecomment-1327627267](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rap4all/issues/1#issuecomment-1327627267)*

## Literate programming

### Why bother?

*Allows you to explain what you're doing as you're coding. This file can later be inflated,
if necessary, to make a package using `{fusen}`.*

## Quarto basics

*Teach some Quarto basics*

## Parametrized reports


## Your project is done (?)

*So here the project is done, but actually it's just an Qmd file that gets compiled, so we would need
to explain why this is not enough, and motivate the readers to go the full way: developing packages,
using targets, and so on*
