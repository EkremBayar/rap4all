# Introduction to reproducibility


*Since we said in the intro to the book that reproducibility is on a continuum, I think that this
chapter should focus on the bare minimum, which would culminate with renv*

*Then at the end, explain why renv is not enough (does nothing for R itself, nor the environment
the code is running on)*
