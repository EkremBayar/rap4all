Data scientists, statisticians, analysts, researchers, and many other
professionals write *a lot of code*.

Not only do they write a lot of code, they must read and review a lot of code as
well. They either work in teams and need to review each others code, or need to
be able to reproduce results from past projects, be it for peer review or for
auditing purposes. And yet, they never, or very rarely, get taught the tools and
techniques that would make the process of writing, collaborating, reviewing and
reproducing projects possible. 

Which is truly unfortunate because software engineers face the same challenges and
solved them decades ago.

The aim of this book is to teach you how to use some of the best practices from
software engineering to make your projects robust, reliable and reproducible. It
doesn’t matter if you work alone, a small or a big team. It doesn’t matter if
your work gets (peer-)reviewed or audited: the techniques presented in this book
will make your projects more reliable and save you a lot of frustration!

The book can be read for free on https://raps-with-r.dev and you can buy a 
DRM-free Epub or PDF on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/)^[https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/].
