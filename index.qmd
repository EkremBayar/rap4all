Data scientists, statisticians, analysts, researchers, and many other
professionals write *a lot of code*.

Not only do they write a lot of code, but they must also read and review a lot
of code as well. They either work in teams and need to review each other’s code,
or need to be able to reproduce results from past projects, be it for peer
review or auditing purposes. And yet, they never, or very rarely, get taught
the tools and techniques that would make the process of writing, collaborating,
reviewing and reproducing projects possible.

Which is truly unfortunate because software engineers face the same challenges and
solved them decades ago.

The aim of this book is to teach you how to use some of the best practices from
software engineering to make your projects robust, reliable and reproducible. It
doesn’t matter if you work alone, a small or a big team. It doesn’t matter if
your work gets (peer-)reviewed or audited: the techniques presented in this book
will make your projects more reliable and save you a lot of frustration!
