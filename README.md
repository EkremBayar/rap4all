# Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R

This is the repository containing the source code to my free
ebook called "Building reproducible analytical pipelines with R".

Read it online here [https://raps-with-r.dev](https://raps-with-r.dev).
On that page, you can click the download button in the sidebar on the left
to download a PDF or EPUB version of the book. You can also buy (the same)
DRM-free PDF or EPUB from [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/) if you
want to support this initiative. 

A print version through Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing is also planned.

If you spot a typo, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
