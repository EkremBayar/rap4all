# Version control

What Miles said on the matter:

*There are still a lot of people that find git intimidating and still potential for some things to go badly for a project if git is used in the wrong way. I once had a colleague who assured me they knew how to use git proceed to use a repo like their personal dropbox folder. Perhaps the details of git usage can be basically waved away, but some detail about good git workflow could be incorporated. For example:
The branching model to use. IMHO trunk-based development works much better than gitflow for analysis teams.
Version number discipline. Why you always bump the version number when making changes to your packages.
Why keeping commits small and confined to just one target at a time if possible is useful when tracing problems with a pipeline.*
