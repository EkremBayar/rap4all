# Advanced topics in reproducibility

If the book ended here, it would be titled "Building analytical pipelines with
R", because we have not ensured that the pipeline we built is reproducible.
We did our best though:

- we used functional and literate programming;
- we documented, tested and versioned the code;
- we used `{renv}` to record the dependencies of the project;
- the project is now a pipeline and re-running it is as easy as it can possibly get.

But there are still many variables that we need to consider. If we go back to
the reproducibility iceberg, you will notice that we can still go deeper. As the
code stands now, we did our best using programming paradigms and libraries, but
now we need to consider another tool, called Docker.

*Now that the readers are familiar with renv, but also its shortcomings, we can go a step further
and introduce Docker. I think some primer on the Linux command line could be included here*


## First steps with Docker

*To write your own Dockerfile, you need some familiarity with the Linux cli, so here's...*
