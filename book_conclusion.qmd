# "So what?"

You’ve reached the end of the book, congratulations! This was not easy, and I
hope that it was worth your time. But if you’ve reached this conclusion and are
still thinking "so what?" I hope to this last attempt of mine to convince you
that RAPs are important will be successful.

So, why bother building RAPs? Firstly, there are purely technical
considerations. It is not impossible that we will work on ever thinner clients
while the the heavy-duty computations will run on the cloud. Should this be the
case, being comfortable with the topics discussed in this book will be valuable.
Also, in the very near future, large language models will be able to set up
most, if not all, of the required boilerplate code to set up a RAP. This means
that you will be able to focus on analysis, but you still need to understand
what are the different pieces of a RAP, and how they fit together. And it is not
a stretch to imagine that simple analyses could be taken over by large language
models as well. So you might very soon find yourself in a position where you
will not be the one doing an analysis and setting up a RAP, but instead check,
verify and adjust an analysis and a RAP built by an AI. Being familiar with the
concepts laid out in this book will help you successfully perform these tasks.

But more importantly, the following factors are inherently part of data analysis:

- transparency;
- sustainability;
- scalability.

It doesn’t matter if you’re working in research, for a public institution or a
private sector company: the three points above are incredibly important and it’s
impossible to perform data analysis without taking these into consideration.

Data analysis, at whatever level and for whatever field, is not just about
getting to a result, the way to get to the result is part of it! This is true
for science, this is true for industry, this is true everywhere. You get to
decide where on the iceberg of reproducibility you want to settle, but the
lower, the better.

So why build RAPs? Well, because there’s no alternative.
