# Conclusion

## "So what?"

You’ve reached the end of the book, congratulations! This was not easy, and I
hope that it was worth your time. But if you’ve reached this conclusion and are
thinking "so what?" I hope to this last attempt of mine to convince you that
RAPs are important will be successful.

So, why bother building RAPs? I think that it all boils down to these factors:

- transparency;
- sustainability;
- scalability.

It doesn’t matter if you’re working in research, for a public institution or a
private sector company: the three points above are incredibly important and it’s
becoming impossible to perform data analysis without taking these into account.
Also, in the very near future, large language models will be able to set up
most, if not all, of the required boilerplate code to set up a RAP. This means
that you will be able to focus on analysis, but you still need to understand
what are the different pieces of a RAP, and how they fit together. And it is not
a stretch to imagine that simple analyses could be taken over by large language
models as well. So you might very soon find yourself in a position where you
will not be the one doing an analysis and setting up a RAP, but instead check,
verify and adjust an analysis and a RAP built by an AI. Being familiar with the
concepts laid out in this book will help you successfully perform these tasks.
