# Functional programming

This chapter will teach you the fundamentals of functional programming. *Functional programming* might
sound scary, but we will focus on only a handful of concepts that are quite accessible while providing
many benefits. Using these functional programming concepts will make your code more reliable, easier
to test, document, share, and ultimately rerun.
